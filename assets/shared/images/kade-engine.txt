theres no such thing as a dogshit eng-

i just looked at kade engine. how could this one pile of a monstrosity of an engine be so popular?

first off, you can't disable the shitty noob-friendly input by default
second, it has a watermark enabled by default (what the fuck?)
and thirdly, it's code is all variables n shit. can kade even code? 

also kade if your looking at this please take this as a joke and dont murder me thank you - bit of trolling
