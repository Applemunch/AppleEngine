# FNFNet
This is the server side for FNFNet.

All the dependencies required are:
```sh
lime
extension-networking
```
# Building
It's simple as:
```sh
lime build windows
```
or
```sh
lime build linux
```
if you are going to use linux for the server.
Make sure you do not run the server as root just incase it gets compromised!

# Troubleshooting
### Client doesn't want to connect
Make sure the port is not occupied by another program.

Another cause can be that your firewall is blocking the connection to the server.
